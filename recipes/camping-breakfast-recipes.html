        <h3>step1</h3>

        <h3>step3</h3>
        <li>Mix onion into potatoes and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return bacon to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <h3>step4</h3>
        <li>Pour beaten eggs over potato mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
